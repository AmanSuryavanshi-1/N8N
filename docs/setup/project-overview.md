# Self-Hosted n8n Workflow Repository

*Created by: Aman Suryavanshi*

This repository contains my collection of n8n workflows, showcasing my journey in building and automating various processes. It serves as a portfolio of my work and a practical reference for implementing n8n in a self-hosted environment.

## What's Inside

This repository includes:

*   **n8n Workflows**: A collection of my n8n workflows, exported as JSON files. Each workflow is designed to solve a specific problem or automate a particular task.
*   **Configuration Files**: My `docker-compose.yml` and an `.env.example` file to demonstrate how I've configured my n8n instance.
*   **Comprehensive Documentation**: My personal `N8N-Notes.md` file, which details my entire n8n journey, from setup to troubleshooting and best practices.

## My n8n Journey

I've been exploring the world of workflow automation with a self-hosted n8n instance, and this repository is a reflection of my learning and progress. My goal is to create a collection of robust, efficient, and well-documented workflows that can be used as a reference for others in the n8n community.

I believe in the power of open-source and sharing knowledge, and I hope that my work can help others on their automation journey.

## Getting Started

To get started with my workflows, you'll need to have a self-hosted n8n instance up and running. You can follow my detailed guide in `Indepth-N8N-Notes.md` to set up your own environment.

Once you have your n8n instance ready, you can import any of the JSON workflows from this repository and adapt them to your needs.

## Disclaimer

Please note that these workflows are my personal creations and may require some adjustments to work in your specific environment. I've done my best to document them thoroughly, but you may need to configure your own credentials and services.
